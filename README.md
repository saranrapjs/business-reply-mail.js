### a digital Business Reply Mail insert

I've designed a small snippet of code that should solve a common problem facing today's webmasters: how do you keep people reading?

The solution that I've come up with is taken straight from print publishing:

![insert](https://raw.github.com/saranrapjs/business-reply-mail.js/master/businessreply.jpg)

When a user scrolls too quickly on a page with `business-reply-mail.js` included, a digital insert will float onto their screen.  At this point, the user can drag the insert out of your way, but not be able to throw it away it until they reload the page.

## Install on your site

The simplest way to install is by including this block of HTML somewhere on your website:

```
<script src="http://bigboy.us/other/business-reply-mail.js"></script>
```

## Install the bookmarklet

You'll need to go to this link: [[link]](http://bigboy.us/other/businessreplybookmarklet.html) and drag the URL into your bookmarks bar.  This will allow you to add the Business Reply insert to other peoples' pages.

## To Do
