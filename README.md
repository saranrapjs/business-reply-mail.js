===================

### a Business Reply Mail insert for the web

This small piece of javascript introduces a powerful publishing tool to the web:

![insert](https://raw.github.com/saranrapjs/business-reply-mail.js/master/businessreply.jpg)

When a user scrolls too quickly on a page with `business-reply-mail.js` included, a digital insert will float onto their screen.  At this point, the user can drag the insert out of your way, but not be able to throw it away it until they reload the page.

## Install on your site

The simplest way to install is by copying and pasting this block of code at the end of the `<body>` tag on your website:

```
<script src="http://bigboy.us/other/business-reply-mail.js"></script>
```

## Use with other sites: install the bookmarklet

You'll need to go to this link: [[link]](http://bigboy.us/other/businessreplybookmarklet.html) and drag the URL into your bookmarks bar.  This will allow you to add the Business Reply insert to other peoples' pages.

## To Do
