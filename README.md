business-reply-mail.js
===================

### a Business Reply Mail insert for the web

This small piece of javascript introduces a powerful publishing tool to the web:

![insert](https://raw.github.com/saranrapjs/business-reply-mail.js/master/businessreply.jpg)

When a user scrolls too quickly on a page with `business-reply-mail.js` included, a digital insert will float onto their screen.  At this point, the user can drag the insert out of the way, but can't throw it away it until the page is reloaded.

#### [Demo: see it in use](http://ilikenicethings.com/darkarts/)

#### Example: the New York Times

## Install it on your site

The simplest way to install is by copying and pasting this block of code in the `<body>` tag on your website:

```
<script src="http://bigboy.us/other/business-reply-mail.js"></script>
```

You can host it on your own site as well: [download the javascript file](https://raw.github.com/saranrapjs/business-reply-mail.js/master/business-reply-mail.js)

## Use with other sites: install the bookmarklet

You'll need to [go to this link](http://bigboy.us/other/businessreplybookmarklet.html) and drag the URL into your bookmarks bar.  This will allow you to add the Business Reply insert to sites which you don't control.
